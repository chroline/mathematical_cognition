## Introduction

Mathematical cognition is the intricate mental processes involved in our ability to understand and apply mathematical
concepts. Despite being a seemingly rudimentary part of the human experience, the capacity to employ mathematical
thinking is a critical aspect of intelligence that plays a vital role in various everyday activities. Mathematical
cognition is often considered a pinnacle of cognitive function in intelligent beings, and serves as a unique lens
through which we can unravel general principles governing problem-solving, decision-making, and abstract reasoning. As
such, the underlying cognitive processes that power these abilities are a subject of profound interest and investigation in cognitive science.

## Project Motivation

This exploratory project builds on top of theories of mathematical cognition and cognitive architectures, and attempts
to apply these concepts and theories in a practical application. This project aims to translate conceptualizations of
mathematical cognition into tangible implementations. In turn, we intend to contribute a novel perspective of
mathematical cognition through the lens of computational modeling.

## Architecture

_WIP_

## Getting Started

To run this project, first install the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the streamlit application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Train Models

To train the models used in this project (namely, the digits classifier, as well as the addition and multiplication
memories), run each of the Jupyter notebooks within the `notebooks` directory. This should create new models within
the `trained_models` directory.
